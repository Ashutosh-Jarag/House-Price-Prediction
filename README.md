# House Price Prediction

## Description
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project repository! This repository contains the code and resources for practicing machine learning techniques by predicting house prices using various algorithms. This project was developed as part of a practice program to gain hands-on experience in machine learning. The goal is to build and evaluate models that predict house prices based on features like size, location, and other attributes, providing a practical application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.

## Required Tools and Libraries
- **Python 3.8+** - Core language for data processing and model development
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations for calculations
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Visualization tools for EDA and result plotting
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Environment for experimentation and analysis

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare house price data for modeling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and house prices
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Model evaluation to compare performance and select the best approach
- Hands-on practice with real-world machine learning workflows

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh-Jarag/House-price-Prediction.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place the dataset (e.g., `House_data.csv`) in the projectâ€™s root directory
4. link = "https://github.com/Ashutosh-Jarag/House-Price-Prediction/blob/main/House_data.csv"
5. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`code.ipynb`) to explore the code and run the models

## Usage
1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook (`House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`) to:
   - Load and preprocess the house price dataset
   - Perform EDA to visualize feature distributions and correlations
   - Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models
   - Predict house prices using the trained models
2. Run the notebook cells to see the analysis, model performance, and predictions
